        <div class="header1"> <h1>About Me</h1></div>
        <p>I'm currently enrolled as a student at Grand Circus within their After Hours Java Bootcamp and work full time
            as a manager in<br>
            Higher Education Foodservice at the University of Michigan.<br><br>

            I've been attracted to the tech field since I was very young; I still vividly remember the day a tech-savvy
            neighbor came to our house<br>
            to hook up our computer to the internet for the first time. It was so surreal to see it come to life in
            front of us! When I was 14 I found my way <br>
            into an IT internship (also at the University) and worked there for two summers as an IT Generalist/network
            admin. <br><br>

            When I turned 16 and got my license, I got a job as a dishwasher at Coney Island because it was 5 minutes
            from my house. <br>
            It seems like I blinked, and now here I stand as a leader, Certified Executive Chef and General Manager
            overseeing hundreds of<br>
            staff in multi-million dollar operations.<br><br>

            After hitting a glass ceiling in my current role, both in terms of growth and my scope of influence, I
            discovered an opportunity at <br>
            Grand Circus' bootcamp and decided to jump head first back into Tech head learning software development. By
            leveraging my professional<br>
            experiences dealing with customer-centric, and interpersonal relationship-dependency in high volume, complex
            systems<br>
            I hope to feed both my personal growth and curiosity, as well as my influence in others.<br><br>

            My long term, highest aspiration is to change the way humans interact with the world in lasting and
            meaningful ways. In the short term,<br>
            I am focused on diving deep into the craft and learning, hands-on, how to think and take decisive action as
            a top-tier developer.<br><br></p>
